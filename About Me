title: "About Me"
Description: "I am a mechatronics engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University fueled by dedication, design, and adaptation. Dedication, as I enjoy committing to any task I work on because of the satisfaction of self-made accomplishment. Design, which is the result of my dedication. Adapt because it has the power to fulfill a common human desire to improve lives, a goal that people frequently overlook. 

With my time in engineering, I have taken the time to grow my knowledge through engineering teams and leadership positions. I am a part of the mechanical team for Toronto MetRobotics, a senior member at TMU Battlebots, and lead stopping mechanism at Chem-E-Car, where I gained insights on 3D model design and experience with physical systems. I also competed in competitions and have built unique projects which won various awards.

I also participate in hobbies like watching movies, photography, swimming, and building Lego sets."
